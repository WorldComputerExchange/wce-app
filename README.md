####World Computer Exchange iPhone App Bundle made for [Global App Initiative](http://globalappinitiative.org/about/)
[World Computer Exchange] (http://www.worldcomputerexchange.org/about-us)
is a nonprofit organization who's mission is: 

>To reduce the digital divide for youth in developing countries; to use our global network of partnerships to enhance communities in these countries; and to promote the reuse of electronic equipment and its ultimate disposal in an environmentally responsible manner.

One of the ways they do this is by refurbishing donated computers, installing educational software and content on them and distributing these computers to developing countries in need. Volunteers go on trips to set up and deliver computers and to collect information. This information includes orders for future trips, evaluations of how equipment is being used, and general information about partner organizations. This is where our application comes in.

Currently volunteers collect this information on paper forms and return these WCE headquarters at the end of their trips. The information then needs to be manually added to WCE's computers. Our application aims to make this process more efficient by allowing volunteers to collect and save this information on their iPhones and send this information directly to World Computer Exchange. 

We make use of open source libraries:
  * [fmdb](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb) a wrapper around SQLite for Objective-C
  * [CHCSVParser](https://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser) helps parsing and writing to CSV files in Objective-C
